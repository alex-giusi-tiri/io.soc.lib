This program controls the GPIO pins of a serially attached module.
It was written for and was tested with the Numato 8- and 16-Channel USB GPIO Modules.

The program currently is written in console mode.
A menu should allow the operator to select custom-defined options (and values) as described in 'values.txt'.
